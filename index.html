            <h1>Volunteered Geographic Information (VGI)</h1>
            <p> VGI applications are geared towards utilizing the information gathered by volunteers, usually members of a community or an organization. This information is usually geared towards governmental institutions, surveys or nature-related research. There is little representation of VGI among at-risk communities.</p>

            <p> A VGI based application tends to have four basic categories for their design. Primarily the format of the data, the features of the application, the community involvement, and visualization of the data for it's users.</p>

            <ul class="cloud" role="navigation" aria-label="Webdev word cloud">
                 <li><a href="#" data-weight="5">Data Format</a></li>
                 <li><a href="#" data-weight="4">Application Features</a></li>
                 <li><a href="#" data-weight="3">Community</a></li>
                 <li><a href="#" data-weight="2">Visualization</a></li>
            </ul>

            <div class="dropdown">
              <span>Data Format</span>
              <div class="dropdown-content">
                <p>This is the primary category of most VGI application, it is the basic organization of the data, how you input it, where it goes, and so forth. Not only is this the most focused on aspect of a VGI applicaiton, it usuaully is the first steps to designing your own application</p>
              </div>
            </div>

            <div class="dropdown">
              <span>Application Features</span>
              <div class="dropdown-content">
                <p>The features of an application is what consumers or volunteers see when they interact with the application. It has to be accessible, understanded by it's target audience. It wouldn't matter how well designed a application is if it doesn't convey that knowledge.</p>
              </div>
            </div>

            <div class="dropdown">
              <span>Community Involvement</span>
              <div class="dropdown-content">
                <p>While many applications might not need direct community involvement, a VGI application by definition depends on it. As the information gathered is done by community members more often than not. Also it is important to mention that if a application involves a community, it is very important that they participate in the design of data format, features, and visualization. They know their community and it's members much more than anyone else. Keeping a connection with the community is a very important aspect of VGI applications. Though it can be overlooked.</p>
              </div>

            <div class="dropdown">
              <span>Visualization</span>
              <div class="dropdown-content">
                <p>Now we've designed the data, created the user interface in the form of the features, and involved the community in all those aspects. But the last but not least category is visualization of said data. You will need to be able to produce understandable visualizations, which can reach as many target audiences as possible. Data doesn't matter if it's presentation is confusing.</p>

						<h1>Protest Mapping</h1>
						<p>While there are few applications of a VGI aspect that are out there for research purposes. One area that sees some excellant examples are protest mapping applications. Protest mappings tend to be focused around the communitcation between protests to help them to streamline communication in real time.</p>

       title="Sukey Application">Sukey Application</A> mascot represents it's use to help protestors to avoid kettling by riot control agencies. This tactic is where law enforcement agencies will slowly block off access routes for groups until they have reduced their impact and space that they can access. By using immediate updating reports from protestors, it's main goal is to keep protestors safe, moving, and communicating.

              <div class="container">
              <p>MayDay Protest, 2017 </p>
              <p> One example of this application in use was during the MayDay Protests in 2017. With this application there were several icons. Representing planned actions, planned marches, Police precincts, unconfirmed actions, and planned pickets.

              By utilizing their application using realtime communication they are able to focus on gathering their fellow protesters to planned events, while avoiding possible interruption or threats. Since there are threats to protesters both from law enforcement and those who wish to disrupt their protests.

              <p>Police "kettling" protesters</p>
              <p>Kettling is the tactic used by law enforcement agencies to break off protesters. Restrict them into smaller and smaller areas, to keep them from moving freely and restrict their abilities to organize.

			<p> At risk communities need to be provided tools for their own success. Outside organizations don't generally have the insight to provide case by case success for communities and the agency of said at-risk groups is important. If they are involved they are invested. From step one to the finished product they should be the key stakeholders. Their opinions and views respected and implemented. A application espicially a VGI one cannot be successful without the community investment. </p>
